        <h1>Story</h1>

<p>Long long ago, there were a lot of BBS systems. They are small and fast and good.
However, those systems grew up since so many time passed. Now they become fat and slow and ugly.
What a disaster!
But no worry about this! Here comes a new star!
Yes, It's QBBS.</p>

<h1>And then?</h1>

<p>Ehhhhh, nothing more to say. It's just being developed. Be patient, dark time will be over.</p>
